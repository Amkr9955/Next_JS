# Nextjs

Next.js is an open-source web development React-based framework created by Vercel, which is famous for its unique features such as Server-side rendering and enhanced SEO. It has some additional features such as data fetching utilities, dynamic API routes, optimized builds, etc. It is a framework built upon React, Webpack, and Babel.

One of the biggest problems with React is that itâ€™s a client-side library, which means it renders the UI on the client browser and this may lead to slow rendering and results in slower page loading time, which is not good for SEO and Next.js solves this problem by providing server-side rendering out of the box and many more problems solutions it problems.
